The woman and three children may have been dead for days before they were found by U.S. Border Patrol near the Rio Grande in South Texas on Sunday, according to a local law enforcement official, who asked not to be named. They are thought to have died from heat exposure and dehydration in an area about 18 miles (29 km) east of McAllen. To the west, U.S. Border Patrol agents in the Del Rio area recovered the bodies of two men on ranchland near Carrizo Springs after anonymous calls on June 19 and June 20 alerted them to lost migrants, the agency said in a statement. Another decomposed body was found June 20 on the riverbank of the Rio Grande near Normandy."

    "story": "[Sheriffs] are looking for 33-year old Marcos Vasquez Ramirez. The family said Ramirez was walking with a group of other people through Bexar County when he suffered some kind of medical episode. The group apparently left the man under a tree somewhere in the area of Loop 1604 and Pleasanton Road, in South Bexar County. The man was either already dead or in the process of dying, according to Salazar. They told the family they were at a certain ranch, by name, Salazar said. They mentioned from that ranch, they walked approximately 20 minutes on foot. Investigators say Ramirez was traveling with a group of people from Guatemala to Houston. His brother, Andres Vasquez Ramirez, told us his brother left Guatemala June 6 and crossed over to the U.S. last Friday. It was also the last day he received any communication from his brother. Andres says they were called by the coyote who smuggled his brother, saying they had left him after his medical episode."
